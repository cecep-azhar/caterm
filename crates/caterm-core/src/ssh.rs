//! Real SSH command surface implemented with `ssh2` and Tokio async channel routing.
//! Active sessions are maintained in an in-memory session registry.
//!
//! `connect` takes only a saved host id — never raw connection details from the frontend.
//! It resolves the host record and its decrypted credential via
//! `crate::store::load_host_for_connect` internally, so a plaintext password/passphrase
//! never has to cross the Tauri IPC boundary on every connect (it was already saved,
//! encrypted, once via `store::save_host`).
//!
//! Two kinds of session live here and they are deliberately kept apart:
//!
//! * **PTY sessions** (`SESSIONS`) back an interactive terminal pane. Their `ssh2::Session`
//!   is switched to non-blocking and is owned by a reader thread that polls it continuously.
//! * **Exec sessions** (`EXEC_SESSIONS`, via [`with_exec_session`]) back every *non*-interactive
//!   consumer — SFTP, monitoring, AI step execution. They are blocking and pooled per host.
//!
//! Sharing one `ssh2::Session` between the two is not safe: a consumer that flips the shared
//! session to blocking mode leaves the PTY reader thread parked inside `read()` while it still
//! holds the channel lock, which freezes the terminal permanently. Every non-interactive caller
//! must therefore go through [`with_exec_session`] and must never touch a PTY session.
