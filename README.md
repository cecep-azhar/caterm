## ⚡ Overview

**CATerm** is a next-generation desktop terminal emulator and server management suite engineered in **Rust** for supreme speed, rock-solid stability, and zero-compromise privacy. It combines an ultra-responsive raw PTY SSH client, full WinSCP-parity dual-pane SFTP manager, real-time remote system metrics monitoring, and intelligent AI-assisted server operations into a sleek, dark-mode native desktop application.

Unlike web-wrapped shells or bloated electron tools, CATerm runs directly on lightweight Rust native binaries with memory footprint strictly optimized under 180MB RSS using `mimalloc` and headless WebKit rendering.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. ⚡ Zero-Delay SSH PTY Terminal
- Built on low-level Rust `ssh2` and Tokio non-blocking async streaming.
- Immediate byte-by-byte PTY flush — zero input delay or typing latency even on high-speed typing and heavy terminal output.
- Full xterm.js compatibility with 256 colors, true color, and native copy/paste.

### 2. 🔄 True Multi-Session Persistence
- Seamlessly open, switch, and split SSH sessions across multiple remote hosts without losing your session state.
- Adding a new host connection never disconnects or restarts background sessions; your remote processes, long builds, and terminal scrollbacks remain alive and uninterrupted.

### 3. 📁 Dual-Pane SFTP Manager (WinSCP Parity)
- Integrated side-by-side local filesystem and remote SFTP file browsers.
- Chunked 64KB high-speed stream upload/download with real-time progress bars and cancel tokens.
- Native keyboard shortcuts (`F2` Rename, `F5` Copy, `F7` New Folder, `F8` Delete, `Ctrl+R` Refresh).
- Visual permissions viewer and chmod editor.

### 4. 🧠 Smart Autocomplete & Autosuggest
- Fish/Zed-style ghost autocompletion right on the active terminal cursor.
- Suggests 200+ curated Linux sysadmin utilities, saved personal vault snippets, and active session command history.
- Press `Tab` or `Arrow Right` to immediately apply commands.

### 5. 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Encrypted Vault
- All sensitive credentials (passwords, private SSH keys, AI API tokens) are encrypted locally using **SQLCipher (AES-256-GCM)** and **Argon2id** key derivation.
- Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero remote key upload. Your keys never leave your device.
- Full encrypted backup and restore (`.catb` format) with passphrase verification.

### 6. 📊 Real-Time Server Monitoring
- Direct non-interactive SSH telemetry polling.
- Live charts and resource monitors for CPU load, RAM utilization, Disk usage, and Network I/O without needing third-party agents on target machines.

### 7. 🌐 Port Forwarding & SSH Tunnels
- Easily configure and manage Local, Remote, and Dynamic (SOCKS5 proxy) tunnels.
- Single-click tunnel activation with live port status indicators.

### 8. 🤖 AI Ops Copilot (Local & OpenAI-Compatible)
- Execute natural-language infrastructure tasks safely.
- Transparent step-by-step proposal review before running any bash commands.
- Full E2EE audit logging of every terminal command and AI execution.

│   └── caterm-app/       # Tauri v2 native desktop application wrapper (IPC, menus, system tray)
├── frontend/             # SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS single-page application (bundled into Tauri)
└── scripts/              # Automated build, packaging, and memory budget validation tools
```
