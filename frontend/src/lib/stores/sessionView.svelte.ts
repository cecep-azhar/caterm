// View state for the terminal workspace: which pane layout is active, whether the remote file
// (SFTP) panel is showing, and which open host the "active" controls apply to.
//
// This lives outside the Session route on purpose. The controls that drive it (Files toggle,
// split buttons) used to sit in a second header bar owned by `/session`, stacked underneath the
// app's own header — two rows of chrome, ~84px, for one row of information. They now render in
// the single app header, which means the layout and the route have to read and write the same
// state. Module-level `$state` survives SPA navigation, so leaving `/session` and coming back
// preserves the arrangement, exactly like the open tabs themselves.
